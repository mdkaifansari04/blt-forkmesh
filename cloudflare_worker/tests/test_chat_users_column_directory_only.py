"""The desktop users column lists registered accounts only (adhoc #8).

The column merges two sources: live roster peers (nodes, but also anonymous
"Guest 3923" browser tabs and World visitors) and the account directory that
/api/accounts/users returns — the users table. Only the second is a list of
people, so the merged groups are filtered back down to it before rendering;
otherwise the column (and its "USERS — 51" count) fills with guests nobody can
look up.

Contracts pinned here:

  * refreshChatMembers() drops every group whose account key isn't in the
    directory, keeping our own row unconditionally.
  * The filter only runs once the directory has actually loaded, so a pending or
    failed fetch can't blank the column.
