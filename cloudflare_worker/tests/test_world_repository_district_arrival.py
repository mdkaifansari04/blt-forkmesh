"""The repository district loads on arrival and rises as its maps are built.

Nothing about the repository district — the catalog, the import list, the
flagship tree, or a single hosted size map — may be requested at boot. The
first character to stand on the repositories ground circle triggers the read,
and the portals then rise out of the ring and shimmer until their size maps
land.
