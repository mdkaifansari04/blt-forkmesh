"""No concurrent asyncio tasks anywhere in the Worker's Python.

The Python Workers runtime snapshot this Worker rides (compatibility_date
2026-07-23; every newer cut is still undeployable — see wrangler.toml) can step
one PyodideTask while another task's step is on the stack. The loop then raises

    RuntimeError: Cannot enter into task <PyodideTask pending ...>
                  while another task <PyodideTask pending ...> is running

the offending task is left pending forever, and from that moment EVERY request
the isolate receives dies the same way: a permanently wedged isolate answering
Cloudflare 1101 until workerd recycles it. Live tails during the 2026-08-05/06
(issue #555) and 2026-08-07 outages showed 30-85% of relay traffic failing this
way, spread across whatever routes happened to be busy — /api/repo/*/*/pending,
git info/refs, the world-general room WebSocket, even /health.

So the Worker's Python must never spawn or interleave a second task:

  * ``asyncio.gather(...)``            -> await the pieces in sequence
  * ``asyncio.wait_for(js_promise)``   -> ``js_fetch_with_timeout``, or a
                                          native ``AbortSignal.timeout`` on
                                          the fetch init
  * ``asyncio.create_task`` /
    ``asyncio.ensure_future``          -> just await it

The sequential form costs a few milliseconds of added latency per request; the
concurrent form costs every request that isolate would have served.
