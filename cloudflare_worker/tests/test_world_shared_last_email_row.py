"""The badge's last-email row reads on everybody, not just on yourself.

adhoc #21: the chest badge showed "LAST EMAIL 2D AGO · DELIVERED" for the
signed-in player and "LAST EMAIL · NOT SHARED" on every other member, because
the stamp only rode the owner's authenticated /api/accounts/sessions read.
Contracts pinned here:

  * The public directory (/api/accounts/users) carries an hour-bucketed send
    time plus the delivery outcome. The address, the email kind and the send
    count stay behind the authenticated read.
  * The World app forwards both fields, and the scene files them as directory
    facts so a member's walking avatar and their campfire bench figure paint
    the same row.
  * A directory member is never "NOT SHARED": no stamp means never emailed.
    Guests — who own no account record — still are.

    replaced it: the stamp now rides the account record, hour-bucketed. The
