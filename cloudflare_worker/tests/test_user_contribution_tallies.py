"""Per-account PR/issue/commit/discussion tallies in the user directory.

The Qt app's admin Users page shows one row per account with a column for
each kind of contribution that account has made. Issues, PRs, and
discussions come from ``contributor_activity`` — the same running tally the
leaderboards use — joined onto the directory read. Commits cannot: nothing
increments that column, because commits reach the mesh as whole-repo
snapshots rather than one signed event apiece, so they are summed out of
``profile_contribution_days`` instead.

Contracts pinned here:

  * ``_account_chat_user_payload`` always emits ``pulls``/``issues``/
    ``commits``/``discussions`` as integers, defaulting to 0 for an account
    the tally has never seen (a LEFT JOIN miss hands the caller NULL).
  * ``_account_users_directory`` LEFT JOINs ``contributor_activity`` on the
    account blind index for the three event-tallied kinds, and takes commits
    from ``_contribution_commit_totals`` keyed by the same blind index.
  * ``_contribution_commit_totals`` counts only public projects on public
    repositories, and one source repo per project, so an unauthenticated
    read of the directory leaks no private activity and a mirrored project
    is not counted once per mirror.
  * Discussions are tallied at all: ``_record_contributor`` accepts the kind
    and ``discussions_handler`` calls it on an accepted event.
  * ``contributor_activity`` carries a ``discussions`` column on fresh
    databases and gains one on already-deployed ones.
