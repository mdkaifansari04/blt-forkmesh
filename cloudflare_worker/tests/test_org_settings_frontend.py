"""The dashboard's Organizations settings tab.

The /api/orgs endpoints (create/list orgs, members, teams, team members,
linked repos) previously had no web client. The Settings page now carries an
"Organizations" sub-tab whose JS (in dashboard/js/04-account.js, bundled into
dashboard.js) drives a master/detail panel over those endpoints. These are
static contracts: the markup hooks the JS binds to must exist, and the JS must
call each endpoint with the right method/path.
