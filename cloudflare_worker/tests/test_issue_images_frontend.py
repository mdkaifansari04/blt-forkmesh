"""Web issue compose form: image attachments (adhoc #85).

Attached images travel as base64 data: URLs embedded in the issue body — no
separate upload channel — so they share the body's MAX_ISSUE_BYTES cap in the
worker. These tests pin the client-side guards (count/size limits, image-only
input), the placeholder flow that keeps the textarea readable, and the
swap-back right before signing so the signed hash covers what is sent.
