"""Contracts for right-click deletion in the World.

The issue asks that an administrator — or anyone running the debug panel —
can right-click on something in the world and delete it. Deleting is the same
kind of local render experiment the Elements tab already offers, one object at
a time instead of one feature at a time: the piece leaves the scene graph and
the raycast list, the choice is remembered on this device, and everything
deleted can be put back.
