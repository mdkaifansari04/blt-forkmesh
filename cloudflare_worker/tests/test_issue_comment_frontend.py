"""Commenting on an issue from the website (adhoc #388).

Issues were read-only on the web: the detail view rendered the signed comment
events already committed to the mirror, but there was no way to add one - unlike
discussions (renderDiscussionReplyForm) and pull requests (renderPullReviewForm).
These contract tests pin the composer, its wiring, and - most importantly - that
the browser signs an issue comment over exactly the bytes the Worker and the
desktop client hash, so the submission verifies instead of 401ing.
