"""Contracts for the World "node served somebody" launch effect.

When a node's signed mirror payload reports that it has answered more clones
or repository web requests than the scene last showed, the cabinet launches a
small figure for the agent it served, shooting up out of the rack and away
into the sky. Like the push surge, it is driven only by the verified payload
the scene already renders — never by an unauthenticated relay frame.
