"""Authors can edit and delete their own dashboard chat messages.

The dashboard chat has always *honoured* inbound "edit"/"delete" frames — from
the desktop client (MainWindowMessages) and the full chat page — but shipped no
way to produce them, so a typo on the dashboard was permanent. These contracts
pin the author-side controls and the frames they broadcast:

* both frames name the message via `target` and are members of DURABLE_TYPES,
  so the relay retains them and later joiners replay the edit/delete rather
  than the superseded original;
* every peer drops an edit/delete whose senderId differs from the original
  message's, so the controls are built only for the author's own rows.
