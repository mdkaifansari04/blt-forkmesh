"""The /chat page must fit the *dynamic* mobile viewport.

On phones the browser's URL/tool bar shows and hides, changing the visible
viewport height. `100vh` reports the *largest* viewport, so a shell sized to
`100vh` overflows: its bottom (the message input and the tail of the scrollable
log) is pushed under the browser chrome, off-screen. The fix is to declare the
`100vh` fallback first and let `100dvh` (the dynamic viewport) win where it's
supported, so the input bar stays reachable and the full message log stays
scrollable on mobile web.
