"""Purchasable World elements: catalog, parameters and the payment split.

Elements are plugins that live in ``public/world/elements`` (a staging area for
a future separate repository). Each one is self-contained geometry plus the
parameters a visitor may set and the endpoints it is allowed to read. This
module is the authority for what an element costs and which parameter values
are accepted; the browser copy may only ever narrow that.

Payment is non-custodial and follows the reward-contribution pattern exactly:
the visitor's own wallet signs one public transfer to the published community
pool address, tagged with a unique per-purchase reference. ForkMesh never
creates a keypair, never holds a key and never sweeps funds. The 50/50 split
described below is therefore expressed as an *unsigned intent* over the half
owed to mirror nodes, which the instance owner's local signer reviews; the
other half stays in the pool that received the transfer.
