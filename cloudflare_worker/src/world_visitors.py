"""Privacy-preserving unique-visitor helpers for the World Arrival Grid.

The Worker transiently combines Cloudflare's edge-observed source address with
this module's deliberately coarse user-agent category, then applies keyed,
domain-separated HMACs.  Neither raw input nor either digest is stored.  Only
each digest's HyperLogLog register and rank enter D1. Temporal digests rotate
at UTC midnight; the all-time digest uses a separate stable context.

This is intentionally an *approximate* unique count:

* people sharing an address and the same coarse client category collapse into
  one visitor (common behind offices, carrier NAT, VPNs, and shared devices);
* one person changing network or client category can count more than once;
* a rolling-hour window crossing UTC midnight can count the same returning
  visitor once on each side of the privacy rotation;
* rotating ForkMesh's data/HMAC secret improves unlinkability but can make a
  returning visitor look new to the all-time sketch.

Those trade-offs avoid turning a playful public counter into an indefinitely
linkable visitor ledger.  A precision of 10 bounds each sketch to 1,024 rows.
