# Give every round-robin git gateway ONE SSH identity, via a host certificate.
#
# ssh.forkmesh.com resolves to several mirrors (see
# www/docs/operations/git-ssh-gateway.md). Each of them has its own host key, so a
# client that pinned one key hits "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" the
# moment DNS hands it a different member. The fix is not to share a private
# host key between machines — it is to have each machine keep its own key and
# present a certificate, signed by one CA, that asserts the shared name.
# Clients then trust the CA once:
#
#   @cert-authority ssh.forkmesh.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
#
#   tools/sign_ssh_host_certs.sh <host-ip> [<host-ip> ...]
#
# Idempotent: re-running re-signs (which is also how certificates are rotated
# before they expire). The CA private key never leaves this machine; only the
# resulting certificate is uploaded.
