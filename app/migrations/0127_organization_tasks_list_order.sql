-- The organization task list orders by (completed_at>0, priority,
-- updated_at DESC, task_id DESC) with LIMIT/OFFSET. No existing index matches
-- that order, so every page sorted the organization's whole task set (~170
-- rows read per 25 returned, several hundred pages an hour while the Tasks
-- page is open). This expression index lets SQLite walk the rows in list
-- order and stop at the page boundary.
