"""The island's boards stand on three circles and only fetch on approach.

One 43-unit perimeter used to carry the public rankings, the social feeds, and
the operational boards together. They are split into a social circle, a
leaderboard circle, and a world-boards circle, and none of them request
anything until a visitor walks onto the circle that carries them.
