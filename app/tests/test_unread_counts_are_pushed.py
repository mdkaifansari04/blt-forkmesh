"""Unread counts are pushed, never polled (adhoc #1604).

"How many unread things do I have?" is a question only the relay can answer,
and clients used to ask it on a beat: the desktop re-read its ping inbox every
five minutes off the heartbeat, /world re-read the ping digest every minute,
and /chat re-read the direct-message list every thirty seconds plus the chat
activity counters every sixty. All four are now one read when the surface
opens, and after that the relay says so: notify_account_event fans a
payload-free {"type":"event","topic"} frame to the account's ForkMeshNodes
Durable Object the moment the write that moved a count lands.

These checks pin that contract on all three surfaces.
