"""World API exponential-backoff contracts (adhoc #1532).

Every World HTTP caller shares one exponential-backoff gate
(public/world/world-backoff.js): a failing endpoint is asked again after
5s, 10s, 20s ... capped at five minutes, Retry-After/429/503 answers are
obeyed, and while an endpoint cools down further attempts are refused
locally instead of hitting the origin. These are source-text pins in the
same style as the rest of the world frontend suite.
